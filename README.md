# ATtiny85 Projects

This repository contains code for two ATtiny85 projects:

1.**WiFi Grabber**
2. **Rubber Ducky**

## WiFi Grabber

- **Inspiration**: This code is inspired by [MTK911](https://github.com/MTK911/Attiny85).
- **Modifications**: I have modified the code to achieve an almost 100% hit rate.
- **Important Note**: Don't forget to change your webhook URL after 5 days (free links expire in 5 days). But don't worry, it's free to generate.

### Usage

1. Upload the provided code to your ATtiny85.
2. Ensure your webhook URL is correctly set in the code.
3. Deploy the device and monitor the results.
